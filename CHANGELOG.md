## Changelog of IPK Calculator Protocol Client

### 1.1 Argument processing

- Added the implementation of arguments, the program now reads the arguments and verifies, if all required arguments have been filled out. 
- The arguments can now come in any order but each specification must follow the correct option argument ( e. g. hostname should follow the "-h" argument), otherwise the correct functionality isn't guaranteed.

### 2.1 Computing expressions

- Function for computing expressions is now implemented and fully functional

### 3.1 TCP Communication and arguments modification

- The program can now communicate with the clients using the TCP protocol.

### 4.1 UDP Communication
